This is Machine learning project for project evaluation
We made a chess engine using ML and AI and the software involved for the interface of chess is pygame where the whole game is being performed
we can set options by changing code like if we want to play with ai or with any real person . also both the players can be ai controlled as well , all 3 options are allowed
the images inloved and code inlvolved is attached .
main code is in chessMain.py file while algorithms used are in SmartMoveFinder.py file . also how every component moves is controlled in Chessengine.py file
Also algorithms involved are - alpha beta pruning, Nega-Max algo , Greedy algo out of which aplha-beta pruning is best suited
hope we are able to justify the project.
Team invloved - Sahil(23/CS/356) , Sakasham Singla (23/CS/361) and Sahdeep(23/CS/355)
